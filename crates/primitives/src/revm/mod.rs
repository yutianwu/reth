/// These functions enable the conversion of data structures between the two implementations, such

///
/// Additionally, it provides a function to calculate intrinsic gas usage for transactions beyond
/// the Merge hardfork, offering compatibility for both Shanghai and Merge Ethereum specifications.

/// These utilities facilitate interoperability and data exchange between Revm and Reth

/// It includes functions to fill transaction and block environments with relevant data, handle
