# Changelog

## v1.0.6

This release merges with upstream version v1.1.0, making the new engine as the default. It includes new features and
several bug fixes.

### NOTE

**This version is compatible with the BSC mainnet, testnet, and opBNB mainnet, testnet.**

### New Features

1. The new engine will be the default engine for BSC, so the experiment flag `--engine.experimental` should be removed when
   running a BSC node.
2. Trie prefetch feature is enabled for the new engine to improve performance, please use `--enable-prefetch` to enable it.
3. Introduced `--optimize.enable-execution-cache` flag to enable cache for the execution of live sync.

### Features

- [#175](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/175): Update the default threshold of merkle rebuild to 50k.
- [#170](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/170): Remove `ChainSpecHardforks` to improve code quality.
- [#163](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/163): Merge with upstream v1.1.0.
- [#164](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/164): Enable prefetch on the new engine.
- [#153](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/153): Enable state cache for live-sync execution.
- [#151](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/151): Add step size check for BSC stage sync.

### Bug Fixes

- [#169](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/169): Fix removing sidecars issue in `remove_blocks_above`.
- [#171](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/171): Fix typo in `Makefile`.

## v1.0.5
This release merges with upstream version v1.0.7, adding support for the BSC mainnet, testnet, and opBNB mainnet, testnet. It includes new features and several bug fixes.

### NOTE
**This version is compatible with the BSC mainnet, testnet, and opBNB mainnet, testnet.**

### New Features
1. Introduced `--engine.experimental` flag to enable the experimental engine for performance improvements.
2. Introduced `--optimize.skip-state-root-validation` flag to skip state root validation during block imports, useful for importing blocks without merkle validation.  
   **Warning:** Use this flag with caution as it may lead to data inconsistency.

### Features
- [#123](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/123): Added support for importing blocks without merkle calculation.
- [#147](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/147): Ensured state root validation is not skipped when inserting downloaded blocks.
- [#157](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/157): Merged upstream version v1.0.7.

### Bug Fixes
- [#137](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/137): Fixed `unwind_to` to ensure it is exclusive.
- [#145](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth/pull/145): Ensured sidecars are correctly written to static files when saving blocks.
